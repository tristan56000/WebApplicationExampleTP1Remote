## How to run ?

Start by running the sql script *script/scriptSQL.sql* into your SQL database terminal.
(Use *MySql* by preference, otherwise the application code might not work)

Once you've done that, run the tomcat server.<br/>
It should open your web browser at the following URL:<br/>
http://localhost:8080/WebApplicationExampleTPRemote1_war_exploded/
